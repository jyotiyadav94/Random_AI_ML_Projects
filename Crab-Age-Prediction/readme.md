# Crab Age Prediction

# About Dataset

## Context
The dataset is used to estimate the age of the crab based on its physical attributes. It serves as a valuable resource for classical regression analysis, feature engineering, and understanding the impact of feature engineering in the Data Science domain.

## Content
Crab is a highly sought-after delicacy, and many countries import a significant amount of crabs for consumption annually. Commercial crab farming offers several advantages, including low labor costs, comparatively lower production costs, and rapid growth rates. The development of commercial crab farming businesses is enhancing the livelihoods of people in coastal areas. With proper care and management, more profits can be earned from crab farming compared to shrimp farming. Mud crabs can be raised in two systems: grow-out farming and fattening systems.

## Inspiration
For commercial crab farmers, accurately determining the age of crabs is crucial for deciding when to harvest them. Beyond a certain age, there is minimal growth in the crab's physical characteristics. Therefore, timing the harvesting process is essential to reduce costs and increase profits. The goal of the dataset is threefold:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand how different physical features change with age.
2. Feature Engineering: Define new features using a combination of given data points to enhance model accuracy.
3. Regression Model: Develop a regression model to predict the age of the crab.
